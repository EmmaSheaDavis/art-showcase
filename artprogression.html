        <p class="mystory">Every child tends to draw but I didnâ€™t really start my journey until I was in the middle of high school. At that time I decided that if I wanted my ideas to come to life I had to do them myself. I have been drawing ever since. First it was only traditional art in cheap sketchbooks. Slowly over time my skill grew and I moved onto digital art, starting first with my phone screen and the tip of my finger. Finally, I had access to an Ipad and stencil. My artistic style grew greatly through the years and I am still learning more each time I pick up my stencil. I first opened my artstyle for commissions in 2023. Accepting projects from other people has allowed me to challenge myself and push my limits further. I still accept commissions today at prices that I feel match the value of my style and work. Check out my commissions page to learn more about my rates and rules!</p>
