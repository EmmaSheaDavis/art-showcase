        My name is Emma Davis. I am 23 years old and an aspiring artist. I have done artworks ranging from fanart of video games to art of my own created ideas and characters. Having been surrounded by amazing artists all my life such as my siblings and friends, I have had the great opportunity to learn from them. It was through the encouragement of these people that drove me to keep drawing and become the artist I am today. I post my works regularly on Instagram and sometimes on X (formally known as Twitter). I am forever grateful for the support I have received from friends and family.

        Almost all of my artworks these days are digital and I use the IbisPaintX program to do my work. Currently I have been interested in animation and have been testing the waters to see if it is something I would like to do in the future.

      <h3>My Art Progression</h3>
      <p>
        Every child tends to draw but I didn’t really start my journey until I was in the middle of high school. At that time I decided that if I wanted my ideas to come to life I had to do them myself. I have been drawing ever since. First it was only traditional art in cheap sketchbooks. Slowly over time my skill grew and I moved onto digital art, starting first with my phone screen and the tip of my finger. Finally, I had access to an Ipad and stencil. My artistic style grew greatly through the years and I am still learning more each time I pick up my stencil. I first opened my artstyle for commissions in 2023. Accepting projects from other people has allowed me to challenge myself and push my limits further. I still accept commissions today at prices that I feel match the value of my style and work. Check out my commissions page to learn more about my rates and rules!
