      <p class="me">My name is Emma Davis. I am 23 years old and an aspiring artist. I have done artworks ranging from fanart of video games to art of my own created ideas and characters. Having been surrounded by amazing artists all my life such as my siblings and friends, I have had the great opportunity to learn from them. It was through the encouragement of these people that drove me to keep drawing and become the artist I am today. I post my works regularly on Instagram and sometimes on X (formally known as Twitter). I am forever grateful for the support I have received from friends and family.</p>
      <p class="artkind">Almost all of my artworks these days are digital and I use the IbisPaintX program to do my work. Currently I have been interested in animation and have been testing the waters to see if it is something I would like to do in the future.</p>
